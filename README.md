# Rent-Calculator_Python-Project
This Rent Calculator is a simple Python program designed to help users calculate the total rent over a specified number of months. 
By inputting the monthly rent amount and the number of months, the calculator multiplies the values to provide the total rent due for the selected period.
Itâ€™s an easy-to-use tool for tenants and landlords to quickly assess rental costs over time.
